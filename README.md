# Reprompt
This morning, I had the thought to build a prompt egineering library. The idea is that when I give a prompt, it'll evaluate the prompt, understand the larger context, understand what the user seeks to achieve from the prompt and rewrite the prompt into a more concise one that's sure to get the exact results the user wants.

I don't want to use an llm tho. I want it to be native and just by installing the library, without an integration with an llm, it's able to do this
